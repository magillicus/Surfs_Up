# Surfs_Up

## Overview
W. Avy consulted me to help him map out a business idea he's been considering: he's dead set on opening a surf shop in Hawaii...with an ice cream parlor. It's actually not a bad idea, as I've always heard that the weather in Hawaii is beautiful all year long. W. Avy doesn't like heresay, though. He wants to be certain that the weather in Oahu is warm enough during both June and December to ensure that his business will be profitable year round. 

## Results

### June vs December : Who Will Bring the Heat?
* June has slightly higher average temperatures than December in Oahu. The average temperature is nearly 4 degrees higher than that in December.
* Oddly enough, the maximum temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than it is in December.
* The largest difference in temperatures between June and December are the lows. June's low temperature is 8 degrees higher than that of December's.

## Summary
Relatively speaking, there isn't a stark difference between the temperatures in Oahu from June as compared to those in December. Although it's more likely to be slightly warmer in June, I think I'd rather be on the beach during Christmas time. Either way, these results show the two extremes...which aren't quite that 'extreme' at all. Its safe to say that Mr. Avy's business will likely be equally successful during any two points of the year, at least when considering weather as the determining factor. I wonder if there are other factors we haven't even thought about...
